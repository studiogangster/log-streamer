# üöÄ log-streamer

A blazing-fast REST microservice that mimics Unix's `head -f` (head with follow) for large log files.  
Easily stream, preview, and monitor logs in real-time‚Äîright from your browser or any HTTP client!

---

## ‚ö° Why is it blazing fast & scalable?

**log-streamer** is engineered for high performance and scalability:

- **Powered by [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp):** Uses one of the fastest HTTP libraries in Go, delivering low-latency, high-throughput request handling.
- **Efficient, buffered file reading:** Reads logs line-by-line with minimal memory usage, even for huge files, using Go's `bufio.Scanner` and direct file seeking.
- **Partial and ranged reads:** Only the required log segments are read and streamed, reducing I/O and memory footprint.
- **Streaming from object storage:** Supports MinIO backend with ranged GETs, fetching only the necessary bytes from distributed storage.
- **Stateless, concurrent design:** Each request is handled independently, leveraging Go's lightweight goroutines for massive concurrency and easy horizontal scaling.
- **Transparent compression:** HTTP responses are automatically compressed for faster delivery.
- **Minimal dependencies:** No heavy frameworks‚Äîjust fast, direct Go code.

This architecture ensures log-streamer can handle high request volumes, large files, and real-time streaming with ease.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/log-streamer.git
cd log-streamer
go build -o log_reader main.go
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t log-streamer .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/logs:/logs log-streamer
```

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
go run main.go
```

---

## üì° API Usage

### Stream the first N lines and follow a log file

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/read?file=/logs/yourfile.log&lines=20&follow=true"
```

- `file`: Path to the log file (inside the container or local path)
- `lines`: Number of lines to read from the start (default: 10)
- `follow`: Set to `true` to keep streaming new lines

### Example Response

```json
{
  "lines": [
    "2024-06-23 12:00:00 INFO Starting service...",
    "2024-06-23 12:00:01 INFO Listening on port 8080",
    "...",
    "2024-06-23 12:00:10 INFO Service ready."
  ]
}
```
